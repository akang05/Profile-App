I am planning to build a Notes application and website that allows users to create, organize, and delete short text entries in real-time. I chose to build this because it provides a practical way to master React's State management and 'lifting state' between components. This project focuses on building a functional user interface that handles dynamic data input and provides immediate visual feedback. I want to be able to also use this project as a base for frontent programming to further expand my knowledge in functionality and being able to apply this coding to future projects.
